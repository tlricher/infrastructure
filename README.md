# infrastructure

This page contains all the patents and patent application publications that have been reviewed in the context of a paper entitled "Infrastructure of Vision: On Perception and Capture in the App Economy," submitted for review to the editorial committee of the academic journal Computational Culture on September 15, 2018. 
These 85 files were classified in two ways:
First, I assigned the patents to 7 different categories, which I defined based on the recurrence of these concepts in the 85 patents/patent applications: visual media capture (6), which refers to the way the app makes use of the photographic hardware available; interpretation of visual content (16), which encompasses functions such as object recognition, emotion analysis, and others related to how images are interpreted; interface and interaction (18), which points to how users access images and interact with the app; network technology (23), which includes all the communication technologies that enable the app’s social functionalities; geolocation (8), which comprises all location-specific functions; hardware (10), which covers all aspects related to Snap’s proprietary eyewear camera; and privacy and security (4), which refers to how the app protects images from unauthorized uses and access. 
Second, In order to evaluate the prevalence of computer vision-enabled functions in these different categories, I then divided all the patents into two groups: those that involve some sort of image analysis or content awareness (36), and those that do not (49). 
Patents were coded based on the year (2013-2018) and order (a, b, c, d, etc.) in which they were granted or published - the 'nickname' given to each of them can be found in the excel document entitled "Patents - Snap". 
All these patents/patent applications were collected through Google Patents on July 15, 2018. Any patent or patent application published after that date was therefore not considered in the context of this paper.
